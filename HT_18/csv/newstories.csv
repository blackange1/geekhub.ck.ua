I&#x27;m trying to figure out what to do this summer.<p>I&#x27;ve already ruled out internships at most tech companies b&#x2F;c<p>1. I spent a gap year working at a wide range of companies (big company, startup, research lab)<p>2. I&#x27;m a reasonably good programmer with open-source projects and while I&#x27;m quite sure I have a lot lot more to learn, I don&#x27;t think a tech internship is the highest-leverage use of my time<p>3. (most important reason) I&#x27;m not sure I want to be a SWE. I love software engineering &#x2F; programming, but when I think of the way to make the <i>most</i> impact in the world it&#x27;s probably creating a (actually meaningful) startup&#x2F;organization. (I know, I know, every young person says this these days)<p>Given that this is the case, I&#x27;m trying to figure out what to do this summer besides a normal tech internship. I was contemplating how to figure out  what to do and decided on a &quot;meta-strategy&quot; of consulting people with more experience on forums such as HN.<p>Here are the options I&#x27;ve come up with so far:<p>1. Try to understand virality -- I&#x27;m not particularly good at creating viral content or content that appeals to the masses (aside from the natural edge that comes from being young), which could certainly be useful when marketing a product. An option here is trying to intern at a company like Buzzfeed which is full of people who understand emotions &#x2F; virality.<p>2. Try to understand soft skills &#x2F; business -- There are roles out there like &quot;business development intern&quot;. I don&#x27;t know anything about &quot;business development&quot; but negotiating with other companies &#x2F; writing white-papers &#x2F; etc. could be a useful skill<p>3. Spend time learning on my own. To enact change these days, it&#x27;s probably not sufficient to just know programming (unless you want to do a SASS). Spending time on my own learning physics&#x2F;chemistry&#x2F;biology could be useful. The issue here is I believe mentorship is useful and this option negates that completely.<p>4. Working on my own business (not a software project). I&#x27;ve done this in the past &amp; learned a lot about how to be scrappy. Not a terrible idea, but I don&#x27;t want to sink 3 months into something only to have to return to school. Also negates mentorship. Also I&#x27;d rather spend time learning right now so I can execute on something that&#x27;s not a local maximum of what my brain can imagine right now.",1643142131,Ask HN: What should a student who is already decent at SWE do over the summer?,story,

trzy,0,30076740,,2,"I built a complete game using Snap&#x27;s AR platform in about 6 weeks. I&#x27;d been intrigued by Snap&#x27;s AR ambitions and wanted to kick the tires on their platform.<p>The YouTube video description contains a link to the Lens: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lens.snapchat.com&#x2F;d04efc6953fd498c87e25c92fef727e7?sender_web_id=6dfa4f56-8eca-4af1-97b3-03057da8df21&amp;device_type=desktop&amp;is_copy_url=true"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lens.snapchat.com&#x2F;d04efc6953fd498c87e25c92fef727e7?s...</a><p>How to play:<p>- Joypad y axis moves the helicopter along the ray pointing from the camera. You can therefore tilt the phone up to fly &quot;up&quot;.<p>- Altitude is also controlled by aiming the phone. The helicopter tries to match the altitude of a point that is fixed in front of the camera. So you can move up by aiming up or by actually lifting the phone higher.<p>- Joypad x axis strafes.<p>- If you lose track of the helicopter, a blue arrow will appear after about 5 seconds.<p>- Blow up enemies and try to stay alive :)<p>How it works under the hood:<p>- Loads of JavaScript. Lenses are surprisingly programmer-friendly. As a non-artist, this is great. Almost everything can be driven completely by code, although most creators opt to use pre-made components with minimal scripting.<p>- The game uses a custom physics engine with OBB-based collision detections that I wrote from scratch. Snap now has integrated physics that seem to be based on PhysX (i.e., the same as Unity&#x27;s) but this was released well into my development process after I had already rolled my own.<p>- I opted not to use environmental mesh reconstruction because it is performance intensive and gives dubious results on lower-end phones. When I started development, it was only enabled for Lidar-based phones but is since available everywhere.<p>- I instead detect horizontal planes using an API that Snap hasn&#x27;t really documented. I found a snippet of code in their API docs and opened up the Lens Studio .exe to find the names of the other plane events I needed.<p>- Planes are used to create collision boxes that extend to the floor so the helicopter can bump into furniture.<p>- AI-controlled enemy helicopters plot routes using a heightmap generated from the plane data to avoid colliding with obstacles when possible.<p>Takeaways:<p>- This has arguably become my favorite AR prototyping platform. Much faster idea-to-PoC iteration time than anything else out there.<p>- The platform is surprisingly full-featured.<p>- The Lens Studio Editor is remarkably polished and, despite some bugs here and there, is very stable.<p>- The deployment story is second to none. Deploying to the phone involves a single click and is done over the Internet (no need for any tethering or wireless pairing).<p>- Debugging on-device is still challenging (all you can do is log a few lines) but I was assured that an actual debugger is coming soon.<p>- Economic viability: unfortunately, it is not really possible to directly monetize lenses. Most creators contract with brands to create branded lenses.<p>Future plans:<p>- I&#x27;ll definitely be keeping an eye on Snap&#x27;s ecosystem.<p>- No plans for any more full-fledged lenses but I do have some ideas for prototypes I&#x27;d like to try in anticipation of commercially viable mixed reality HMDs hitting the market soon (e.g., Meta&#x27;s Project Cambria).<p>- I may update the game with a tutorial mode and a co-located multiplayer mode (co-op play or PvP) provided I get the necessary support from the Snap dev team.<p>Hope you enjoy and are inspired to dive into AR if you haven&#x27;t already :D",1643138876,Show HN: A full AR helicopter action game built as a Snap lens,story,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_1dJ_x7vXw

In a single statement we are 1) reading a CSV (of purchases) with automatic header detection, dialect detection, type inference and casting, 2) filtering out records that do not belong to the IT department or do not have a purchase timestamp 3) summing the total purchases and grouping by how many days ago they happened, 4) sorting from the most to the least recent day and 5) writing the result in JSON format.

With the current Wordle craze we realized we could make a web-playable version with Wordle-style emoji sharing etc, so that&#x27;s what we did.<p>We obviously don&#x27;t expect it to be anywhere near as popular as Wordle, but hopefully people enjoy the spatial puzzle aspect of it. We aren&#x27;t worried about making money, it&#x27;s just a fun way to get more people to play our game.<p>As far as tech goes, the original game was made in Unity, but we decided to make this version using Pixi.js to cut down on load times. We do some interesting stuff to pre-generate puzzles (using dancing links&#x2F;algorithm x), which we can talk about if there are questions about it.",1643125387,Show HN: We made a playable web version of our word puzzle game,story,https://sidewords.ca
